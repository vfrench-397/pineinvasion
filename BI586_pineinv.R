#########Visualize Raw data

#First, lets look at quality profile of R1 reads
##visualize quality score - this is where you can decide to visually create a quality cutoff of "X"
##eg. in first plot, would want to cutoff above ~20
##x axis "cycle" = bp length (reads = no. basepairs)
plotQualityProfile(fnFs[c(1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9)])
plotQualityProfile(fnFs[c(10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18)])
plotQualityProfile(fnFs[c(19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27)])
plotQualityProfile(fnFs[c(28,29,30,31,32,33,34,35)])
plotQualityProfile(fnFs[c(36,37,38,39,40,41)])

#Recommend trimming where quality profile crashes - in this case, forward reads mostly fine up to 300
#For common ITS amplicon strategies with paired end reads, it is undesirable to truncate reads to a fixed length due to the large amount of length variation at that locus. That is OK, just leave out truncLen. Make sure you removed the forward and reverse primers from both the forward and reverse reads though! 

#Make directory and filenames for the filtered fastqs
filt_path <- file.path(path, "trimmed")
if(!file_test("-d", filt_path)) dir.create(filt_path)
filtFs <- file.path(filt_path, paste0(sample.names, "_F_filt.fastq.gz"))

# Filter
out <- filterAndTrim(fnFs, filtFs, truncLen= 300, #end of single end reads = approx. 300 bp
                     maxN=0, #DADA does not allow Ns - filter out Ns (degenerate base)
                     maxEE=1, #allow 1 expected errors, where EE = sum(10^(-Q/10)); more conservative, model converges
                     truncQ=2, 
                     trimLeft=20, #N nucleotides to remove from the start of each read: ITS2 primer = F 20bp
                     rm.phix=TRUE, #remove reads matching phiX genome
                     compress=TRUE, multithread=FALSE) # On Windows set multithread=FALSE

head(out)
#3789 was the number we saw in the grep terminal for that file -- sanity check yourself
#reads.out=no. of reads you lost--normal if numbers look less than here, that's normal (about 50% of reads lost??)
tail(out)

#A word on Expected Errors vs a blanket quality threshold
#Take a simple example: a read of length two with quality scores Q3 and Q40, corresponding to error probabilities P=0.5 and P=0.0001. The base with Q3 is much more likely to have an error than the base with Q40 (0.5/0.0001 = 5,000 times more likely), so we can ignore the Q40 base to a good approximation. Consider a large sample of reads with (Q3, Q40), then approximately half of them will have an error (because of the P=0.5 from the Q2 base). We express this by saying that the expected number of errors in a read with quality scores (Q3, Q40) is 0.5.
#As this example shows, low Q scores (high error probabilities) dominate expected errors, but this information is lost by averaging if low Qs appear in a read with mostly high Q scores. This explains why expected errors is a much better indicator of read accuracy than average Q.

##### Learn Error Rates #######
################################
#DADA2 learns its error model from the data itself by alternating estimation of the error rates and the composition of the sample until they converge on a jointly consistent solution (this is similar to the E-M algorithm)
#As in many optimization problems, the algorithm must begin with an initial guess, for which the maximum possible error rates in this data are used (the error rates if only the most abundant sequence is correct and all the rest are errors).

setDadaOpt(MAX_CONSIST=30) #increase number of cycles to allow convergence
errF <- learnErrors(filtFs, multithread=TRUE)
#Maximum cycles was set to 30, but Convergence was found after 4 rounds
#errF may take a long time 

#sanity check: visualize estimated error rates
#error rates should decline with increasing qual score
#red line is based on definition of quality score alone
#black line is estimated error rate after convergence
#dots are observed error rate for each quality score

plotErrors(errF, nominalQ=TRUE) 

################################
##### Dereplicate reads #######
################################
#Dereplication combines all identical sequencing reads into “unique sequences” with a corresponding “abundance”: the number of reads with that unique sequence. 
#Dereplication substantially reduces computation time by eliminating redundant comparisons.
#DADA2 retains a summary of the quality information associated with each unique sequence. The consensus quality profile of a unique sequence is the average of the positional qualities from the dereplicated reads. These quality profiles inform the error model of the subsequent denoising step, significantly increasing DADA2’s accuracy.
derepFs <- derepFastq(filtFs, verbose=TRUE)
# Name the derep-class objects by the sample names
names(derepFs) <- sample.names

################################
##### Infer Sequence Variants #######
################################

#Must change some of the DADA options b/c original program optomized for ribosomal data, not ITS - from github, "We currently recommend BAND_SIZE=32 for ITS data." leave as default for 16S/18S
setDadaOpt(BAND_SIZE=32)
dadaFs <- dada(derepFs, err=errF, multithread=TRUE)

#now, look at the dada class objects by sample
#will tell how many 'real' variants in unique input seqs
#By default, the dada function processes each sample independently, but pooled processing is available with pool=TRUE and that may give better results for low sampling depths at the cost of increased computation time. See our discussion about pooling samples for sample inference. 
dadaFs[[1]] #looking at number of sequence variants found; 6 here
dadaFs[[25]]

#construct sequence table
seqtab <- makeSequenceTable(dadaFs)
head(seqtab) #gives sequence, then number of that sequence found in each sample

################################
##### Remove chimeras #######
################################
#The core dada method removes substitution and indel errors, but chimeras remain. 
#Fortunately, the accuracy of the sequences after denoising makes identifying chimeras easier 
#than it is when dealing with fuzzy OTUs: all sequences which can be exactly reconstructed as 
#a bimera (two-parent chimera) from more abundant sequences.

seqtab.nochim <- removeBimeraDenovo(seqtab, method="consensus", multithread=TRUE, verbose=TRUE)
dim(seqtab.nochim)
# Identified 1 bimeras out of 117 input sequences.

sum(seqtab.nochim)/sum(seqtab)
#The fraction of chimeras varies based on factors including experimental procedures and sample complexity, 
#Most of your reads should remain after chimera removal (it is not uncommon for a majority of sequence variants to be removed though)
#For our sample, this ratio was 0.9998201, there was only 1 bimera

##### Assign Taxonomy #######
################################

#It is common at this point, especially in 16S/18S/ITS amplicon sequencing, to classify sequence variants taxonomically. 
#DADA2 provides a native implementation of the RDP's naive Bayesian classifier. The assignTaxonomy function takes a set of sequences and a training set of taxonomically classified sequences, and outputs the taxonomic assignments with at least minBoot bootstrap confidence.
#Here, I have supplied a modified version of the GeoSymbio ITS2 database listing more taxonomic info as phyloseq requires (Franklin et al. 2012)
#For example: GeoSymbio data (taken from "all clades" at https://sites.google.com/site/geosymbio/downloads):
#>A1.1
#modified version for phyloseq looks like this instead:
#>Symbiodinium; Clade A; A1.1

taxa <- assignTaxonomy(seqtab.nochim, "GeoSymbio_ITS2_LocalDatabase_verForPhyloseq.fasta", minBoot=5,multithread=TRUE,tryRC=TRUE,outputBootstraps=FALSE)
#minboot should be higher
#Obtain a csv file for the taxonomy so that it's easier to map the sequences for the heatmap.
write.csv(taxa, file="taxa.csv",row.name=TRUE,quote=FALSE)
unname(head(taxa, 30))
unname(taxa)

#Now, save outputs so can come back to the analysis stage at a later point if desired
saveRDS(seqtab.nochim, file="final_seqtab_nochim.rds")
saveRDS(taxa, file="final_taxa_blastCorrected.rds")

#If you need to read in previously saved datafiles
seqtab.nochim <- readRDS("final_seqtab_nochim.rds")
taxa <- readRDS("final_taxa_blastCorrected.rds")
